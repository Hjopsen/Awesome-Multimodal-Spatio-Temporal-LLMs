| Knowledge Mechanisms in Large Language Models: A Survey and Perspective | Arxiv | 2024.07 | [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15017) | provide a novel taxonomy including knowledge utilization and evolution. Knowledge utilization delves into the mechanism of memorization, comprehension and application, and creation. Knowledge evolution focuses on the dynamic progression of knowledge within individual and group LLMs. |
